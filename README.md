## Bright Data scraping browser quick start guide

The **Scraping Browser** is a new headful (GUI) automated browser. It was built on top of the Bright Data Web Unlocker infrastructure with the aim of providing a [Puppeteer](https://github.com/puppeteer/puppeteer) or [Playwright](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-python) compatiable solution for bypassing bot detection on large scale web scraping projects. 

## How to use the Scraping Browser

If you don’t have a verified [Bright Data](https://get.brightdata.com/vitariz8264) account, signing up is free. When your preferred payment method is confirmed you’ll receive a $5 credit to test this tool. Initial rate is $20/GB.

**Step 1:** to create a Scraping Browser zone — go to your Bright Data dashboard, navigate to **‘My Proxies’** page, and under **‘Scraping Browser’** click the **‘Get started’** button.

**Step 2:** Add a name for your newly created Scraping Browser zone on the **‘Create a new proxy”** page.
Please select a reasonable name for the zone as it cannot be altered once it was created. To create and save your zone, click **'Add proxy'**.

**Step 3:** In order to begin your first Scraping Browser session using **Node.js** or **Python**, here is the initial step for both. Head to your zone’s **‘Access parameters’** tab. There you’ll find API credentials which consist of a  Username (Customer_ID), Zone name (attached to username), and Password. These will be required in the following integration examples.
